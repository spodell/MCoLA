Metagenomic co-localization analysis

The scripts in this repository can be used as a pipeline to identify specific protein annotations occurring on within a specified distance of each other on the same assembled metagenomic (or genomic) contig. 

Reference [1] below describes the application of this pipeline to identify co-localized pairs of carbohydrate digestive enzyme (CAZy) and arylsulfatase (SulfAtlas) classified enzymes in metagenomic data sets from the digestive systems of herbivorous fish and terrestrial ruminants.
